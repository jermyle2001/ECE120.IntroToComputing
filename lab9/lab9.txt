QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab9.bin.)

ANSWER: The program will modify the register 0x3000. When it is run, the program will AND the value stored with x00000 and add the decimal number 12 to the value, storing it in R2/ 0x3000. The program stops after performing this operation due to the halt command in the line below it.ls


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: The ability to step through a program grants the programmer/designer the ability to easily debug, as it allows the programmer to effectively troubleshoot at what line of code or function that is not behaving as anticipated, allowing the programmer to figure out what needs to be fixed and where it's located in the program.
